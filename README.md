# FS22_BetterCoverCrops

This is a mod in progress for Farming Simulator 22 which aims to allow the following things:
- Add a fertilizer stage when mulching cover crops (like oilseed radish)
- Add a fertilizer stage when rolling over cover crops, also terminating them
- Add a fertilizer stage when direct seeding into cover crops
