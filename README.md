# FS22_BetterCoverCrops

## Mod description

This mod strives to allow the player to respect the three [Conservation Agriculture](https://www.fao.org/conservation-agriculture/en/) principles.

## Implemented Features

- Cover Crops and Forageable crops can be mulched or rolled over, in which case they will be mulched and will apply the maximum possible fertilization on the field. (rolling cuts the fruit but does not add a mulch layer yet)

## Planned features

- Add a mulch layer when rolling
- Add one level of fertilizer instead of maxing out
- Support precision farming
- Change the ground visuals to a mulched ground
- Properly handle root crops and special crops like cotton or poplar
